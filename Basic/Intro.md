# Introduction to PHP
- PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular server-side scripting language that is widely used for web development.
- It is known for its ease of use, flexibility, and versatility.
- In this README, we will discuss the basics of PHP, including how it is executed and some of its key features.

# How PHP Runs
 When a client sends a request to a web server that is running PHP, several things happen:

- The web server identifies that the request is for a PHP script and sends the script to the PHP interpreter.
- The PHP interpreter then reads and executes the code in the script.
- During this process, the interpreter may connect to a database or a third-party API to retrieve or manipulate data as required by the PHP script.
- Once the script has finished executing, the interpreter generates a response, typically including HTML, XML, or other types of data.
- Finally, the web server sends the response back to the client, which renders the output in the user's web browser.

# Scripting vs Programming Languages
- PHP is a scripting language that is also considered a server-side programming language.
The main difference between scripting and programming languages is in how the code is executed.
- Scripting languages are interpreted at runtime, meaning that the code is executed line-by-line as it is encountered.
Programming languages, on the other hand, are typically compiled before execution, meaning that the code is converted into machine code before being executed.

# PHP's Execution Process
As previously mentioned, PHP is typically executed as an interpreted language, meaning that the code is executed line-by-line as it is encountered.
However, modern versions of PHP also include a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler that can dynamically compile the code to machine code as it runs, improving performance.

# Interacting with Server-Side Resources
During the execution process, the PHP interpreter may interact with various server-side resources, such as files, sessions, and cookies, depending on the requirements of the PHP script.
This allows PHP to create dynamic and interactive web applications that can respond to user input and other events in real-time.
